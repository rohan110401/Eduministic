                            <p className="font-fontVollkorn mx-8 self-center text-black font-medium text-xl text-justify tracking-wide">A test tube, also known as a culture tube or sample tube, is a common piece of laboratory glassware consisting of a finger-like length of glass or clear plastic tubing, open at the top and closed at the bottom. Test tubes are usually placed in special-purpose racks. In laboratory equipment, a beaker is generally a cylindrical container with a flat bottom. Most also have a small spout (or beak) to aid pouring, as shown in the picture. Beakers are available in a wide range of sizes, from one milliliter up to several liters. An Erlenmeyer flask, also known as a conical flask (British English) or a titration flask, is a type of laboratory flask which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825â€“1909), who created it in 1860. Erlenmeyer flasks have wide bases, with sides that taper upward to a short vertical neck. They may be graduated, and often spots of ground glass or enamel are used where they can be labeled with a pencil. It differs from the beaker in its tapered body and narrow neck. Depending on the application, they may be constructed from glass or plastic, in a wide range of volumes.
