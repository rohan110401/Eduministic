Project build for hacking 4 community hackathon  

## Demo
The demp video of the project can be viewd from [here](https://youtu.be/sAbijlrAdYs)

## 💡 Inspiration
We all know about the impacted of COVID 19 and how it has impacted the whole education system. Eduministic enables us to learn with 3D models, which makes our understanding easier.

## 💻 What it does
Eduministic enables us to learn with 3D Models, which makes our understanding easier, and faster. Eduministic is a web platform where students from any background can visit the site and learn various concepts with the help of 3D Models, which makes their understanding easier, and faster

## ⚙️ How it works
- First user need to Log In/Sign Up
- Then students can navigate to study page
- On the study page user can interact with various 3D models and learn various concepts.

## 🔨 How we built it
- For frontend we have used React Js, and tailwind CSS for styling
- For rendering the 3D model into our site we have used react-three-fiber
- For authentication we have used Firebase

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
The most challenging task was to add a 3D model into react application. We achieved this using react-three-fiber.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing project on time, and collaboration

## 📖 What we learned
Using React Three fiber

## 🚀 What's next for Eduministic
- Adding more 3D model
- Deploying it to the web
